- protocol: RESP2 and RESP3
  - RESP3 can carry out-of-band / “push” messages on a single connection, where-as RESP2 requires a separate connection for these messages
  - RESP3 can (when appropriate) convey additional semantic meaning about returned payloads inside the same result structure
  - Some commands (see this topic) return different result structures in RESP3 mode; for example a flat interleaved array might become a jagged array
- data structure:
  - hashset: 
- database: Redis by default have 16 databases that can be selected by using SELECT command.  since Redis Cluster only supports database zero.
