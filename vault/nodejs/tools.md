- @rushstack/heft: a config-driven toolchain that invokes other popular tools such as TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, Webpack, and API Extractor. 
- @microsoft/api-extractor: API Extractor provides an integrated, professional-quality solution for all these problems. It is invoked at build time by your toolchain and leverages the TypeScript compiler engine to:
  - Detect a project's exported API surface
  - Capture the contracts in a concise report designed to facilitate review
  - Warn about common mistakes (e.g. missing exports, inconsistent visibility, etc.)
  - Generate *.d.ts rollups with trimming according to release type
  - Output API documentation in a portable format that's easy to integrate with your content pipeline
- @rushstack/rig-package
